Industrial Projects
======
**Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communications in 5G Networks** (Jan. 2023 -- present)

**Learning for Improving Primal Heuristics of Mixed Integer Programming Problems** (Jan. 2021 -- Dec. 2021)
- Propose a Bi-layer Prediction-based Reduction Branch (BP-RB) framework to speed up the process of finding a high-quality feasible solution for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.
- Propose a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based problem reduction method that removes unnecessary variables and constraints to significantly reduce the required memory and time.
- Evaluate the BP-RB on representative NP-hard problems.
- **Applications**: Resource allocation in wireless communication networks
